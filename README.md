# Discord.js-Bot
This is a discord bot made by me, and it is used by the Open Source Discord Server (discord.gg/zXwKzBa)

# Use
You are free to use this bot and it's code as you please, but you are required to follow the GNU AGPLv3 license, which can be found in the LICENSE file.

# How to use
This bot was made for a specific discord server. This means that I have added features that were needed in said discord server. I have tried to make as much as possible customizable for easier use, but you can follow the rest of this to see what each config does and how it is used.

# About
This bot was made by me. If you want to know more about it, you can add me on Discord. My username and tag is LoggyDogDog#0001. Alternatively you can join the Open Source discord server and see for yourself how it works from a members perspective.

# Features
This bot includes multiple features. Here are some of them:

A log function that allows you to make the bot send a message to a log channel / specific text channel that says who did what and in what channel.

A timed mute command.

A kick command.

A softban command.

A ban command.

# Upcoming features
In the future I am hoping to be able to add more features. Here are the ones I am hoping to add:

A striking system using a database of some kind.

  Automatic punishment depending on how many strikes are issued.
  
A music player.

Possibly try to create a dashboard online instead, but I doubt that this will be done unless I find out a way to do it automatically as I have little to no experience with HTML5.

# Installation
Here I will explain the config.json file, and what you need to put in it.

The prefix is the beginning of each command. An example of this is !.

The token is where you put your bot token.

The welcome is where you put the welcome channel ID.

The server name is where you put the server name.

The log channel is where you put the log channel ID.

The version is the version. I left this blank for ease of use when I upload it.

The embed color allows you to change the universal color of all the embeds. It uses HEX code.

The command channel is the channel that you allow commands in. Normal commandes (except for staff commands) are only available in the command channel to avoid spam.

The member role is the ID for the member / user role, aka the normal role.

The muted role is the ID for the muted role.

The verify channel is where you put the ID of the verification channel.

The verify role 1 and 2 is where you put the roles that are added when someone verifies themselves using !verify in the verification channel.

The administrator, owner and moderator configs is where you put the role id's to the respective roles.
