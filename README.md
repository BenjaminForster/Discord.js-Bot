# Discord.js-Bot
This is a discord bot made by me, and it is used by the Open Source Discord Server (discord.gg/zXwKzBa)

# Use
You are free to use this bot and it's code as you please, but it has to follow the GNU AGPLv3 license, which can be found in the LICENSE file.

# How to use
This bot was made for a specific discord server. This means that I have added features that were needed in said discord server. I have tried to make as much as possible customizable for easier use, but you can follow the rest of this to see what each config does and how it is used.
